## Welcome to my Pokemon API code repo!

This repository includes:
 - A Jupiter notebook containing all relevant code used to create the dataset
 - A csv file with my final cleaned dataset
 - This README file :)

No .gitignore file is needed because the PokeAPI doesn't require an API key to use.

The variables in the dataset are id, name, height, weight, type, and region. The height is measured in meters, and weight in kilograms. Since many pokemon have 2 types, the dataframe has duplicate rows of some pokemon to account for both of their types.
